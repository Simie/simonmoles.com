# Networked party-multiplayer prototype game for mobile devices.

- Status: Unfinished
- Year: 2014-2015

In Gravitational, the player controls a single planet in a crowded solar system orbiting around a bright sun.
The aim is to build up economy and buildings on your planet to fuel the war machine, massive interplanetary turrets that fling projectiles around the sun to hit your enemies.
Or yourself by mistake.
