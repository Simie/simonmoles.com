# Squad-based action RPG for tablet devices.

![Banner][banner]

- Status: Unfinished
- Year: 2013-2014

Nova is a squad-based action RPG for tablet devices. 
I collaborated with an artist to create the visual style, silhouetting ships against a bright background and overlaying heavy glow effects for weapons, engines, highlights. 
A major focus was to take advantage of touch controls and streamlining interactions with the UI and squad control.
