# Me
Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I'm a software developer and game developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. I currently work at my game dev startup, [Stompy Robot][stompy_robot].
Take a look at my [projects][projects] to see what I've worked on.

# My Skills
I have been programming since I was 13 years old. Eleven years on, I'm still eagerly seeking new things to learn and skills to develop.

I've worked with a wide range of technologies, but my primary skills lie in C# and the Unity3D game engine. 

#### Highlights
- Fluent in __C# / .NET__.
- Extensive experience with __Unity3D__ engine.
- Familiar with __C__, __C++__, __Objective-C__, __Java__.
- Application development with __WPF/WinForms__.
- Web development with __HTML/CSS/Javascript__.
- Networking with __lidgren__, __Unity__.
- Development with __Visual Studio__.
- Version control with __Git / SVN__.
- Build pipelining with __Jenkins / CI__.
- App development with __XCode + iOS SDK__.

I have also dabbled in languages such as Haskell, Python, and Ruby.
