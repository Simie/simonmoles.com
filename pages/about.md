# Me
Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I'm a software developer and game developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. I currently work for Rockstar Games as a systems designer.

On the side I work at my game dev startup, [Stompy Robot][stompy_robot]. Take a look at my [projects][projects] to see what I've worked on.

# My Skills
I have been programming for over 15 years since my early teens, initially as a hobby but now professionally for over 8 years. Over this time I've explored a wide range of technologies and problem spaces from web development with HTML/JS, to mobile apps for iOS with Objective C. 

My primary skills lie in C# and the Unity3D game engine, both of which I have used for over 8 years.

#### Highlights
- Fluent in __C# / .NET__.
- Extensive experience with __Unity3D__ engine.
- Familiar with __C__, __C++__, __Objective-C__, __Java__.
- Application development with __WPF/WinForms__.
- Web development with __HTML/CSS/Javascript/React__.
- Networking with __lidgren__, __Unity__.
- Development with __Visual Studio__.
- Version control with __Perforce / Git / SVN__.
- Build pipelining with __Jenkins / TeamCity / CI__.
- App development with __XCode + iOS SDK__.

I have also dabbled in languages such as Haskell, Python, and Ruby.
